 *                           INTERFACE TO OpenMM
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * These four functions and an opaque structure are used to interface our main
 * program with OpenMM without the main program having any direct interaction
 * with the OpenMM API. This is a clean approach for interfacing with any MD
 * code, although the details of the interface routines will differ. This is
 * still just "locally written" code and is not required by OpenMM.
 *
 * This is our opaque "handle" class containing all the OpenMM objects that
 * must persist from call to call during a simulation. The main program gets
 * a pointer to one of these but sees it as essentially a void* since it
 * doesn't know the definition of this class.
